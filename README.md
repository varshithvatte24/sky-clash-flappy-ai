## 🤖 How the AI Works

The AI bird uses a simple reactive logic:

* It checks the position of the next upcoming pipe.
* If it’s near the bottom pipe opening, it flaps to avoid collision.
* It doesn’t learn—just reacts fast.

## 📌 TODO / Ideas for Future

* [ ] Smarter AI using neural networks (NEAT algorithm)
* [ ] Sound effects and background music
* [ ] Leaderboards synced via a backend
